My name is Jiaxuan Li (tɕa˥ ɕʷæn˧˥ lʲi˥) and I am a second-year master student in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. As a computational psycholinguist, my research build bridges between human brains and machines, addressing how human language is represented and processed in mind, and how it is different from machine language. I am concerned with (i) the temporal and hierarchical aspects of syntactic and semantic processing in real-time language comprehension, (ii) the role of attention in second language acquisition, and (iii) how humans compute expectations about the upcoming linguistic inputs, in comparison with NLP models. I use behavioral, electrophysiological methods (e.g. eye-tracking, self-paced reading, EEG), as well as computational modeling with state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g. GloVe, LSTM, transformers). 

I am currently working with [Dr. Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/) on the neural nature of contextual effect on online sentence comprehension. We propose that there would be distinct neural processes for unexpected linguistic inputs in high- v.s. low-constraining contexts, as well as language prediction derived from high- v.s. low-levels of representation. I am also supervised by [Dr. Allyson Ettinger](https://aetting.github.io/index.html) to implement a neuro-computational noisy-channel model to explain the discrepancies in psycholinguistic research of sentence processing, including the argument-role reversal effect and semantic illusion effect. 

Before that, I received my bachelor degree at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, with a major in Chinese linguistics and a minor in computer science. I had trainings in theoretical linguistics, cognitive neuroscience and computer science. I was supervised by [Dr. Stephen Polizter-Ahles](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/sjpolit/) to investigate graded semantic prediction in sentence comprehension with Chinese classifiers. Starting from this project, I became interested in the interaction between psychological experiments and computational modeling, and how interdisciplinary methods could be useful to address problems in language processing and learning. 

I was born and raised in Taiyuan, a small town in northern China known for minerals. Besides, I speak Mandarin, Chinese Jin dialect, Cantonese, and Japanese. Other than psycholinguistics, I am foodie of Cantonese cuisine and play games on Nintendo Switch and Steam.
